# Classic Traveller 

These are a summarization of the classic traveller rules, made to be more easily read.

# Introduction
- This document is meant players, the first section **Characters** covers the character creation process.
- This creation process can be seen as its own small game and is somewhat involved.
- For every four years of your characters life, after 18, you must roll dice and make decisions.
- These four year sections are called terms, they are represented by spans of education or careers.

## Character Generation Checklist
1. Generate the six personal characterstics, roll 2d6 for each.
    - Strength
    - Dexterity
    - Endurance
    - Intelligence
    - Education
    - Social Standing
2. Select a branch of server and apply for enlistment: Navy, Marines, Army, Scouts, Merchants, Other.
    - If accepted go to step 3.
    - If rejected, submit to the draft (you may still get accepted into your first choice).
3. Determine survival, this is a 2d6 roll, see the prior service table.
4. Officer Rank.
    - If uncommissioned, apply for commission.
    - If commission, apply for promotion.
5. Determine skills recieved for this term.
    - For service.
    - For commission received.
    - For promotion recieved.
    - Automatic skills.
6. If completing the 4th or later term of service, check for aging effects.
7. Roll for permission to reenlist.
    - For voluntary (or mandatory) reenlistment, go to step 3.
    - If disallowed, go to step 8.
8. Mustering Out.
    - Roll for cash and benefits.

# Characters
## Initial Character Creation
- First generate your characteristics, in the game these will determine your **reactions** and **abilities**.
- For each characteristic on the characteristics table roll 2d6 and record the result on a character sheet.
- Results are between 2 and 12, 7 being average, and these could be modified down to 1 and up to 15.
- A value would only go below 1 due to calamatous injury or aging, which can happen during character creation.

- Hexidecimal format means intead of 1 to 15, numbers are expressed from 0 to F.
- This means that 10 is the same as A, and so on until 15 is the same as F.
- An average character would be 777777, but one with a high intelligence would be 777B77 where B is 11.

### Names, Titles, Rank
- Pick your character name, it can be your real name if you want.
- If your social standing is B / 11 or higher, you may have a title. See the **Noble Titles** table below.
- At Referee discretion, players with titles may also have lands.
- Players may use their rank as a title, if they recieve one during character creation.
- Ranks are tied to commissions and promotions, these are explained in the **Services** section.

# Combat

Combat is deadly

## Basic Combat Concept
- This system covers violent encounters between characters and another group of people or beasts.
- The referee determines the circumstances of the encounter, such as likelihoods and reactions.
- Combat covers successive attacks by each character involved, an attack being melee or weapon fire.
- A successful hit occurs on a 8 or higher with a 2d6, and the hit is subject to DMs (die modifiers).
- Modifications can be made based on range, expertise, types of weapons, surprise, and other factors.
- On a successful hit, wounds are inflicted based on the type of weapon used.
- Each combat round, where everyone may attack, lasts 15 seconds.
- All attacks in a combat round are simultaneuos, meaning if someone dies they may still attack that round.
- Combat rounds continue until one side or party is vanquished, flees, dies, or surrenders.

## Procedure

Once an encounter occurrs the following procedure is used to to determine the combat's resolution. 

### Combat Procedure
1. Determine facts of the encounter:
    - Which party has **Surprise**?
    - Initial **Encounter Range**.
    - Possible **Escape and Avoidance**?
2. Begin combat round.
    - Inividual movement status
    - Individual targets and attacks.
        1. Attacker's DMs
        2. Defender's DMs
    - If attack succeeds, determine wounds
    - Begin new round, (go to 2).
3. Combat end, attend to wounded and regroup forces.

### Surprise
- Surpise allows one party to avoid combat or gain a surpise attack.
- Each party rolls 1d6, apply any modifers per the **Suprise DMs** chart.
- If any one party has a total greater than the others by 3, the high roll achieves surpise.
- Only one party can achieve surpise, if not achieved both sides are aware of each other.
- If one side achieves **Surprise** they may elect to avoid combat, see **Escape and Avoidance**.
- If a party with surpise elects to enter combat, each member may attack until surpise is lost.
- See the **endurance** rule for the definition of suprise blows.
- Surpise is lost when some manner of alarm occurs, such as the sound of gunfire or screams of pain.
- Unsilenced shots are considered an alarm; exlcuded are silenced pistols, laser weaspon, and guns in vacuum.
- Someone hit by an attack, but not rendered dead or unconscious, will make an alarm. 
- If an alarm is not raised after someone is hit, someone else may see the person fall dead or unconscious.
- The standard roll to determine if someone notices a comrade collapse is a throw of 9+ on a 2d6.
- Surprise continues until it is lost, and therefore may continue indefinitely.
- Once surpise is lost, normal combat begins.

### Surpise DMs
| Relevant information  | Modifier |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Leader skill          |     +1   |
| Tactical skill        |     +1   |

| Pouncer animals       |     +1   |
| Battle Dress          |     +2   |

### Range
- Encounters occur at one of five ranges: close, short, medium, long, very long.
- The initial range of an encounter is determined by the referee or randomly by a roll.
- If determined randomly, roll 2d6 on the **Encounter Range** table.
- Also, modify the results of this roll with modifiers from the **Terrain DMs** table.

| Range     | Bands    | Description                | Distance          | Escape DM |
|-----------|----------|----------------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Close     | 0        | Physical contact, touching | 0 meters          |    -1     |
| Short     | 0        | At sword or polearm point  | 1 to 5 meters     |     0     |

| Very Long | 11 to 20 | At extreme range           | 251 to 500 meters |    +3     |

### Escape and Avoidance
- Without surpise, a party may *attempt* to avoid contact or escape an encounter.
- A party which has achieved surprise may always avoid contact or escape from an encoutner.
- A party of NPCs that have surpise and are outnumberd, but avoid on a 2d6 roll of 7+ (no DMs).
- If neither party has surprise, then either may attempt to escape immediately before combat.
- Before combat, to escape roll a 9+ on 2d6, modified by range.
- Escape range modifiers are -1 within close, +1 medium range, +2 if long, + 3 if very long range.
- A NPC character will attempt to escape at the referee's discretion, for animals see Book 3.
- Once combat begins, you must use movement to leave the field of battle.

### Movement
- When moving in combat, distances are measured in range bands, each approximately 25 meters.
- Moving from the short range (1m to 5m) to close range (0m / touching) is considered 1 band.
- Characters move one band per combat round if **walking**, up to 25 meters.
- Characters move two bands if **running**, up to 50 meters, no attacks.
- Characters move four bands if **riding** a vehicle or animal, up to 100 meters.
- Animals may move faster than this, see Book 3.
- All movement is simultaneous, each character has their own movement.
- Any characters 20 bands away from the nearest enemy is "out of range" and has escaped.

### Movement Status
- Before each combat round, players must state thier movement status. 
- there are four possible movement statuses: evade, close range, open range, and stand.
- **Evade**: No attacks in return for DM for defense based on attacker range.
  - Short or close range DM.........  -1
  - Medium range DM............... -2
  - Long or Very Long range DM....  -1
- **Close Range**: Moving in closer to the enemy; may walk, run, or ride (vehicle, animal)
  - Walking: 1 band, 25 meters.
  - Running: 2 bands, 50 meters. No attacks, considered a combat blow, reduce endurance.
  - Riding: a vehicle or animal, 4 bands, 100 meters.
- **Open Range**: Moving away from the enemy; may walk, run, or ride (vehicle, animal)
  - May move from close range to 1 band away without running.
  - Walking: 1 band, 25 meters.
  - Running: 2 bands, 50 meters. No attacks, considered a combat blow, reduce endurance.
  - Riding: a vehicle or animal, 4 bands, 100 meters.
- **Stand**: No movement during this combat round.

### Combat Resolution
- Combat is resolved through a series of attacks, represented as dice rolls, made by combatants.
- A **Combat Round** contains each attack made by all characters capable of attacking.
- Combat concluded when one party is routed, killed, or has surrended. 
- **Basic Required Roll**: each combantat selects a target character and makes a 2d6 roll.
  - A successful hit is on a roll of 8 or higher, after modifiers.
  - There are numerous dice modifiers, see the **Combat Modifiers Chart**
  - After a successful hit, the wound column on the **range matrix** will determine the damage.
- **Wounding and Death**: Wounds depend on the weapon type used, see the range matrix.
  - Wound points are temporarily applied to the target's strength, dexterity, and endurance.
  - Each die rolled is taken as a single wound or group of hits, and is applied to 1 characterstic.
  - The first wound received can be sufficient ...
